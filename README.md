# Crime-Analysis-in-Delhi
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of crime patterns in Delhi City, focusing on 5 broad categories of crimes and their sub-narrow categories. By examining the frequency of these crimes in various districts, we aim to identify crime-prone areas and track changes in crime rates over the past 4-5 years.
